## FAQ

### Q: How to scrobble music to LastFM, LibreFM, ListenBrainz or GNU FM?

Use other music scrobbler apps. I
recommend [Pano Scrobbler](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arn.scrobble).

### Q: How to export downloaded song files?

*InnerTune* supports SAF. You can find the provider in Android native file manager. You can also
use [Material Files](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.zhanghai.android.files)
with [instruction](https://github.com/z-huang/InnerTune/issues/117#issuecomment-1295090708) (
recommended).

### Q: Why InnerTune isn't showing in Android Auto?

1. Go to Android Auto's settings and tap multiple times on the version in the bottom to enable
   developer settings
2. In the three dots menu at the top-right of the screen, click "Developer settings"
3. Enable "Unknown sources"

example of Jetpack Compose and music player. It helped me a lot on my way to learn Compose and
Android development.
